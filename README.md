# Mathematical Visualizations Demo

This interactive web application demonstrates various mathematical concepts through visual animations and patterns. Visit [https://isato-oishi.github.io/math-demo/](https://isato-oishi.github.io/math-demo/) to explore the following visualizations:

## Features

- **Fractal Pattern**: A recursive triangle fractal that demonstrates self-similarity at different scales
- **Wave Function**: An animated sine wave showing periodic motion
- **Mandelbrot Set**: The famous mathematical set of points in the complex plane
- **Lissajous Curves**: Beautiful patterns created by parametric equations
- **Ulam Spiral**: A graphical depiction of prime numbers arranged in a spiral
- **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: Visual demonstration of an ancient algorithm for finding prime numbers
- **Goldbach Conjecture**: Visualization of the famous number theory conjecture
- **Fibonacci Spiral**: Colorful visualization of the Fibonacci sequence arranged in a spiral pattern

Each visualization is interactive and updates dynamically as you resize the window. The animations use HTML5 Canvas for smooth rendering and performance.

## Technologies Used
